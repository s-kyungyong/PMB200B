Pathogens are typically under very high evolutionary pressures for survival, which also places effectors under **strong selection**. It turns out the most plasible evolutionary explanation is that **this gene cluster originated from a single ancestor and underwent repeated duplication and divergence** (just like NLRs or many other expanded gene families across tree of life!) (Fig. 7). The divergence was simply so rapid and divergent that no sequence-based method could have detected the similarity of these homologs.

We are simply **inferring (or predicting!) evolution based on sequences and structures**. There are always false positives (non-homologs detected to be homologous) and false negatives (homologs detected not to be homologous). Stay critical during data interpretation, and understand well the characteristics of your sequences and proteins!"
